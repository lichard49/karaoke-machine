00:00:05,233 --> 00:00:07,333
Yeehaw

2
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,633
Baby I’ve been to a couple rodeos

3
00:00:16,633 --> 00:00:20,133
But the place that I’m headed ain’t got no roads

4
00:00:20,133 --> 00:00:23,633
So tell me if you down for a helluva ride

5
00:00:23,633 --> 00:00:26,666
And hop up on this saddle and hold real tight

6
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:30,066
So giddy up (hyah, hyah)

7
00:00:30,066 --> 00:00:31,600
So giddy up (hyah, hyah)

8
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,600
Even if it’s just for the night

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,899
So giddy up (hyah, hyah)

10
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:41,199

00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,766
My life, real fast

12
00:00:44,766 --> 00:00:48,100
Check my wallet, no cash

13
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,266
Few beers in my tummy

14
00:00:51,266 --> 00:00:54,666
Make me wanna ride through the wide open country

15
00:00:54,666 --> 00:00:58,199
No one's around me

16
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,633
Wind in my face, heart beating as I race

17
00:01:01,633 --> 00:01:04,433
No one's around me

18
00:01:04,433 --> 00:01:07,266
Who can change my goddamn mind

19

New boots yeah you know they Balmain

32
00:01:49,633 --> 00:01:53,100
No one's around me

33
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:56,533
Wind in my face, heart beating as I race

34
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:59,299
No one's around me

35
00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:02,033
